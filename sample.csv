Early and personal life

Bezos was born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen in Albuquerque, New Mexico to Jacklyn (née Gise) and Ted Jorgensen.[10] His maternal ancestors were settlers who lived in Texas, and over the generations acquired a 25,000-acre (101 km2 or 39 miles2) ranch near Cotulla. Bezos's maternal grandfather was a regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in Albuquerque. He retired early to the ranch, where Bezos spent many summers as a youth, working with him.[11] At an early age, he displayed mechanical aptitude – as a toddler, he tried dismantling his crib.[12]

Bezos's mother Jacklyn was a teenager at the time of his birth. Her marriage to his father lasted a little more than a year. When Jeff was four, she remarried, to Miguel Bezos, a Cuban who immigrated to the United States alone when he was fifteen years old. Miguel worked his way through the University of Albuquerque, married Jacklyn and legally adopted his stepson Jeff. After the wedding, the family moved to Houston, Texas, and Miguel became an engineer for Exxon. The young Jeff attended River Oaks Elementary School in Houston from fourth to sixth grade. As a child, he spent summers at his grandfather's ranch in southern Texas, ""laying pipe, vaccinating cattle and fixing windmills.""[13]

Bezos often displayed scientific interests and technological proficiency; he once rigged an electric alarm to keep his younger siblings out of his room.[14] The family moved to Miami, Florida, where he attended Miami Palmetto Senior High School. While in high school, he attended the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida, receiving a Silver Knight Award in 1982.[15] He was high school valedictorian[16] and was a National Merit Scholar.[17]

He attended Princeton University, intending to study physics, but soon returned to his love of computers and graduated summa cum laude, with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering in electrical engineering and computer science. While at Princeton, he was elected to the honor societies Phi Beta Kappa and Tau Beta Pi. He also served as the President of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space.[18]

In July 2012, Bezos and his wife personally donated $2.5 million to pass a same-sex marriage referendum in Washington.[19]

Bezos has spent $42 million to fund the first full-scale Clock of the Long Now, designed to last 10,000 years.[20][21]

Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, have four children, including an adopted daughter from China and three sons.[4] [22]

Business career

After graduating from Princeton in 1986, Bezos worked on Wall Street in the computer science field.[23] Then he worked on building a network for international trade for a company known as Fitel.[24] He next worked at Bankers Trust.[25] Later on he also worked on Internet-enabled business opportunities at D. E. Shaw & Co.[26]

Amazon.com

Bezos founded Amazon.com in 1994 after making a cross-country drive from New York to Seattle, writing up the Amazon business plan on the way. He initially set up the company in his garage.[27] He had left his ""well-paying job"" at a New York City hedge fund after learning ""about the rapid growth in Internet use"", which coincided with a then-new U.S. Supreme Court ruling holding that mail order catalogs were not required to collect sales taxes in states where they lack a physical presence.""[13]

Amazon's shares rose by 70% in 2011, adding $6.5 billion to Bezos's net worth.[28]

Bezos is known for his attention to business details. As described by Portfolio.com, he ""is at once a happy-go-lucky mogul and a notorious micromanager: ""an executive who wants to know about everything from contract minutiae to how he is quoted in all Amazon press releases.""[27]

Blue Origin

In 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, a human spaceflight startup company,[29] partially as a result of his fascination with space travel,[30] including an early interest in developing ""space hotels, amusement parks, colonies and small cities for 2 million or 3 million people orbiting the Earth.""[16] The company was kept secret for a few years until it became publicly known only in 2006 when purchasing a sizable aggregation of land in west Texas for a launch and test facility.[31]

In a 2011 interview, Bezos indicated that he founded the space company to help enable ""anybody to go into space"" and stated that the company was committed to decreasing the cost and increasing the safety of spaceflight.[32] Blue Origin is ""one of several start-ups aiming to open up space travel to paying customers. Like Amazon, the company is secretive, but [in September 2011] revealed that it had lost an unmanned prototype vehicle during a short-hop test flight. Although this was a setback, the announcement of the loss revealed for the first time just how far Blue Origin's team had advanced.""[30] Bezos said that the crash was 'not the outcome that any of us wanted, but we're signed up for this to be hard.'""[30] A profile published in 2013 described a 1982 Miami Herald interview he gave after he was named high school class valedictorian. The 18-year-old Bezos ""said he wanted to build space hotels, amusement parks and colonies for 2 million or 3 million people who would be in orbit. 'The whole idea is to preserve the earth' he told the newspaper .... The goal was to be able to evacuate humans. The planet would become a park.""[4]

In 2013, Bezos reportedly discussed commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies with Richard Branson, multibillionaire founder of Virgin Group and Chairman of Virgin Galactic.[33]

The Washington Post

On August 5, 2013, Bezos announced his purchase of The Washington Post for $250 million in cash. The sale is personal to Bezos. Amazon.com will not be involved.[34] ""This is uncharted terrain,"" he told the newspaper, ""and it will require experimentation.""[34] Shortly after the announcement of intent to purchase, The Washington Post published a long-form profile of Bezos on August 10, 2013.[4] The sale closed on October 1, 2013, and Bezos' Nash Holdings took control.[35]

In March 2014, Bezos made his first significant change at the Post and lifted the online paywall for subscribers of some number of U.S. local newspapers including The Dallas Morning News, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, and the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.[36]

Recognition

He was named Time magazine's Person of the Year in 1999.[37] In 2008, he was selected by U.S. News & World Report as one of America's best leaders.[38] Bezos was awarded an honorary doctorate in Science and Technology from Carnegie Mellon University in 2008. In 2011, The Economist gave Bezos and Gregg Zehr an Innovation Award for the Amazon Kindle.[39]

In 2012, Bezos was named Businessperson of The Year by Fortune.[40]

He is also a member of the Bilderberg Group and attended the Swiss 2011 Bilderberg conference in St. Moritz, Switzerland.[41] He is a member of the Executive Committee of The Business Council for 2011 and 2012.[42]

As of July 2014, according to Forbes's The World's Billionaires list, Bezos is listed as the 17th wealthiest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $32.3 billion.[43] He was ranked the second best CEO in the world by Harvard Business Review, after Steve Jobs of Apple.

He was named World's Worst Boss by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), at their World Congress, in May 2014. In making the award Sharan Burrow, General Secretary of the ITUC, said ""Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the American corporate model...” [44]

An expedition funded by Jeff Bezos recovered two powerful Saturn V first-stage F-1 rocket engines from the Atlantic Ocean. They were positively identified as belonging to the Apollo 11 mission's S-1C stage in July 2013.[45]

Lars Rebien Sorensen,"Mr Sørensen (born 10 October 1954 ) is CEO of Novo Nordisk A / S .

Mr Sørensen was in Forestry from the Royal. Veterinary and Agricultural University in 1981 and Diploma in Foreign Trade from the Copenhagen Business School in 1983 .

He joined Novo Nordisk in 1982 in the marketing of enzymes , and in 1989 he was sales and marketing director for the enzyme business. He joined the Group Executive Board in May 1994 and got in December of that year special responsibility for medicine business. When the enzyme business in 2000 was spun off in Novozymes , he took over the post of CEO of Novo Nordisk after Øvlisen .

He sits on the Board of Danmarks Nationalbank and the board of Dong Energy .

Making moves in China

Lars Rebien Sørensen
President and CEO
Novo Nordisk AS

Lars Rebien Sørensen, president and CEO of Novo Nordisk ($NVO) since 2000, joined the company in 1982 in marketing, and so genuinely knows the company from bottom to top. He is at the helm of a company that is weathering the financial storms rather well, and with its focus on metabolic disorders in a world where diabetes is increasing, both in the developed and the developing worlds, Novo Nordisk looks set to continue comfortably under his leadership, and be a role model for the industry.

China is exciting for the biopharma industry--long seen just as a place for low-cost manufacturing, it is increasingly emerging as a biopharma market. This is driven by the improving incomes and quality of life increasing access to (and desire for) healthcare. However, this rising income is a double-edged sword--as people embrace a more Western-style lifestyle they also take on the Western-style diseases of obesity, diabetes, lipid disorders and cancer. China also has a huge aging population, with all the associated diseases of old age.

Sørensen is grasping this opportunity, not by the established route of buying up domestic Chinese generics companies but by creating a brand-new R&D center in China to develop innovative drugs for the local and international market and so contributing to the local community. Something else that Novo Nordisk is doing that should be an example to the industry is educating local physicians directly and through the Chinese government and Chinese academic institutions. Diabetes is also climbing in Qatar and Novo Nordisk is part of an educational partnership there.

Under Sørensen, Novo Nordisk has changed its approach to people with diabetes (and their physicians)--rather than encouraging people to switch, it's aiming to catch people as soon as they are diagnosed. It might only seem like a small change, but it could drive the company toward a much larger bite of the market, because once people get established on a form of insulin, they tend to be loyal. Also in diabetes, Novo Nordisk is using a ""me-slightly-better"" rather than a ""me-too"" approach to insulin development in an already crowded market. These are approaches that could work across the industry, and not just in diabetes--why develop a ""me-too"" when you could make something that's actually better?

Since Sørensen joined Novo Nordisk, he has been a distinctive voice in the access to medicines debate. Under him, the company has maintained its ethical stance while still making a profit, and this is a strand that runs through many of its projects, including the investment of $100 million to create the World Diabetes Foundation, and the commitment to provide insulin at 20% of its standard price to people in the developing world.

Health for Sorensen isn't just a market, it's a personal commitment--he is a keen cyclist and was one of a group of CEOs at Davos who introduced the Workplace Wellness Alliance to promote health and fitness to employees. Workplace health programs, as well as being socially responsible, also have an ROI of $4 per $1 spent-a pragmatic move that deserves to move out across the industry, both for the sake of the employees and for the bottom line.
Sorensen is married to Charlotte IDIN Sorensen, and together they have three children."

CEO of PotashCorp

Bill Doyle was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of PotashCorp on July 1, 1999, after 12 years as a member of the PotashCorp senior management team. He has served on PotashCorp’s Board of Directors since the company was first listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges in 1989.[5] While CEO of PotashCorp, Doyle led the company to become “an agribusiness powerhouse that controls some of the most valuable and coveted assets on Earth.”[6] With a market capitalization of less than $625-million when it went public in 1989, PotashCorp now has a market capitalization of approximately $33-billion(U.S.)[7]

During his time as CEO, Mr. Doyle oversaw the growth of PotashCorp from C$1.35 billion to C$32.46 billion. Several strategic investments made by PotashCorp in the Middle East, South America and Asia during Mr. Doyle’s tenure including a 32% ownership in Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM);[8] a 28% ownership interest in the Arab Potash Company (APC) of Jordan;[9] a 22% ownership interest in Sinofert Holdings Limited (Sinofert) in China;[10] and, growth in holdings of Israel Chemicals Limited (ICL) from 9% to 14%.[11]

Philanthropy

In 2013, Doyle led PotashCorp’s partnership with Free the Children, and the creation of the global charity’s food security pillar of the Adopt a Village development model.[12] Adopt a Village supports community development in areas featuring a high incidence of child labour and exploitation of children.[13]

In December 2012, Doyle directed PotashCorp’s participation as a founding partner of the Global Institute for Food Security at the University of Saskatchewan, a “public-private partnership that enables innovative, multi-disciplinary research, training and technology development to improve sustainable crop production, enhance human and animal nutrition, and address the growing global demand for safe, reliable food”.[14] Under the terms of this partnership, PotashCorp will contribute up to $35 million over seven years to the Global Institute for Food Security, with the Government of Saskatchewan providing up to $15 million over the same period.[15]

Mr. Doyle is a graduate of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and Vice Chair of the University’s Board of Directors.[16] In 2011, Bill Doyle and his wife Kathy gave a $10 million endowment to Georgetown to establish the Doyle Engaging Difference Program,[17] a “campus-wide collaboration between the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs, the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship, and Georgetown College designed to deepen the university’s own commitment to tolerance and diversity and enhance global awareness of the challenges and opportunities of an era of increasing interconnectedness.”[18] He is also on the board of the Big Shoulders Fund, a charity providing support to Catholic schools in the neediest areas of inner-city Chicago.[19]

Compensation

In 2007 he was by far the highest earning CEO in Canada, earning over $320 million, and nearly doubling the next nearest earner, Jim Balsilie.[20]
